I am an **Undergraduate Student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr)**.
I once used to be interested in machine learning and data mining algorithms.
Now, I'm getting attracted to concurrent programming that really drives the scalable system and applications.
Trying to become **[Rust](rust-lang.org)** enthusiast:fire:
