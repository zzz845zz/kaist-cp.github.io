I am a **Master Student at KAIST [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr)** at [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://www.fearless.systems).

My interest lies in formal verfication low-level concurrent data structures and systems.
I am especially interested in modular and automatic verification of them using separation logic such as [Iris](https://iris-project.org).

Currently, I am researching on improving the automation of [Diaframe](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/diaframe), an automation tool for Iris.
I wish to improve its usability in aiding the proof of more complex data sturctures and systems, scaling up to thousands of lines of proof code.

I am also interested in designing specifications for weak memory data sturctures, especially for ones that does not have a clear sequential specification.
