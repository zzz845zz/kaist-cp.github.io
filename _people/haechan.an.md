I am **Master's student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/)**.
The followings are my interests: **Programming language theories** including formal semantics, abstract interpretation, interactive theorem proving and concurrency; **Building complex systems** such as compilers in safe and usable languages like Rust; Additionally, applying **learning-based techniques** to the above area.

I've worked on building [AI serving systems](https://www.fearless.systems/ai-system).
Currently, I'm finding research topics related to the automation of formal verification.

Details of my experiences are at [my personal webpage](https://anhaechan.github.io/).
