I am an **Undergraduate Student at [Department of Mathematical Sciences at KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/)**.
I am grateful to start pursuing a Master's degree (advisor: [Prof. Jeehoon Kang]({{ site.baseurl }}{% include person_url.md person_id="jeehoon.kang" %}) from Spring 2020.
I'm interested in various topics including but not limited to verification of
concurrent and distributed systems, tools for easier concurrent programming,
and type systems.
