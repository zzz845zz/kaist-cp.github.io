I am an **Undergraduate Student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr)**. The area of Computer Science that piqued my interest, during the years I've been studying at KAIST, is Computer Systems. For this reason, I was eager to join [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr).
