  abstract:
    "Formal verification is an effective method to address the challenge of
    designing correct and efficient concurrent data structures. But
    verification efforts often ignore <em>memory reclamation</em>, which
    involves nontrivial synchronization between concurrent accesses and
    reclamation. When incorrectly implemented, it may lead to critical safety
    errors such as use-after-free and the ABA problem. Semi-automatic safe
    memory reclamation schemes such as hazard pointers and RCU encapsulate the
    complexity of manual memory management in modular interfaces. However, this
    modularity has not been carried over to formal verification.
    <br />
    We propose modular specifications of hazard pointers and RCU, and formally
    verify realistic implementations of them in concurrent separation logic.
    Specifically, we design abstract predicates for hazard pointers that
    capture the meaning of <em>validating</em> the protection of nodes, and
    those for RCU that support <em>optimistic traversal</em> to possibly
    retired nodes. We demonstrate that the specifications indeed facilitate
    modular verification in three criteria: compositional verification, general
    applicability, and easy integration. In doing so, we present the first
    formal verification of Harris's list, the Harris-Michael list, the
    Chase-Lev deque, and RDCSS with reclamation. We report the Coq
    mechanization of all our results in the Iris separation logic framework."

  abstract:
    "Hazard pointers is a popular semi-manual memory reclamation scheme for
    concurrent data structures, where each accessing thread announces the
    protection of each object to access and validates that the pointer is not
    already freed. Validation is typically done by <em>over-approximating</em>
    unreachability: if an object seems to be unreachable from the root of the
    data structure, the protecting thread decides not to access the object as
    it might have been freed. However, many efficient data structures are
    incompatible with validation by over-approximation as their <em>optimistic
    traversal</em> strategy intentionally ignores the warning of unreachability
    to achieve better performance.
    <br />
    We design HP++, an extension to
    hazard pointers that supports optimistic traversal. The key idea is
    <em>under-approximating</em> unreachability during validation and
    <em>patching up</em> the potentially unsafe accesses arising from
    false-negatives. Thanks to optimistic traversal, data structures with HP++
    outperform the same-purpose data structures with HP under contention while
    consuming a similar amount of memory."

  abstract: "Persistent memory (PM) is an emerging class of storage technology that combines the performance
            of DRAM with the durability of SSD, offering the best of both worlds. This had led to a surge of
            research on persistent objects in PM. Among such persistent objects, concurrent data structures (DSs)
            are particularly interesting thanks to their performance and scalability. One of the most widely used
            correctness criteria for persistent concurrent DSs is <em>detectable recoverability</em>, ensuring both
            thread safety (for correctness in non-crashing concurrent executions) and crash consistency (for
            correctness in crashing executions). However, the existing approaches to designing detectably recoverable
            concurrent DSs are either limited to simple algorithms or suffer from high runtime overheads.
            <br />
            We present Memento: a <em>general</em> and <em>high-performance</em> programming framework for detectably
            recoverable concurrent DSs in PM. To ensure general applicability to various DSs, Memento supports
            primitive operations such as checkpoint and compare-and-swap and their composition with control constructs.
            To ensure high performance, Memento employs a timestamp-based recovery strategy that requires fewer writes
            and flushes to PM than the existing approaches. We formally prove that Memento ensures detectable
            recoverability in the presence of crashes. To showcase Memento, we implement a lock-free stack, list, queue,
            and hash table, and a combining queue that detectably recovers from random crashes in stress tests and
            performs comparably to existing hand-tuned persistent DSs with and without detectable recoverability.

  abstract: "Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a cutting-edge storage technology that promises the
             performance of DRAM with the durability of SSD. Recent work has proposed several
             <em>persistency models</em> for mainstream architectures such as Intel-x86 and Armv8,
             describing the order in which writes are propagated to NVM. However, these models have
             several limitations; most notably, they either lack operational models or do not support
             persistent synchronization patterns.
             <br />
             We close this gap by revamping the existing persistency models. First, inspired by the
             recent work on promising semantics, we propose a <em>unified operational style</em> for
             describing  persistency using <em>views</em>, and develop view-based operational
             persistency models for Intel-x86 and Armv8, thus presenting the <em>first</em> operational
             model for Armv8 persistency. Next, we propose a <em>unified axiomatic style</em> for
             describing hardware persistency, allowing us to recast and repair the existing axiomatic
             models of Intel-x86 and Armv8 persistency. We prove that our axiomatic models are equivalent
             to the authoritative semantics reviewed by Intel and Arm engineers. We further prove that
             each axiomatic hardware persistency model is equivalent to its operational counterpart.
             Finally, we develop a persistent model checking algorithm and tool, and use it to verify
             several representative examples."

  abstract: "All pointer-based nonblocking concurrent data structures should deal with the problem
             of <em>safe memory reclamation</em>: before reclaiming a memory block, a thread should
             ensure no other threads hold a local pointer to the block that may later be
             dereferenced.  Various safe memory reclamation schemes have been proposed in the
             literature, but none of them satisfy the following desired properties at the same time:
             <em>(i) robust</em>: a non-cooperative thread does not prevent the other threads from
             reclaiming an unbounded number of blocks; <em>(ii) fast</em>: it does not incur
             significant time overhead; <em>(iii) compact</em>: it does not incur significant space
             overhead; <em>(iv) self-contained</em>: it neither relies on special hardware/OS
             supports nor intrusively affects execution environments; and <em>(v) widely
             applicable</em>: it supports many data structures.
             <br />
             We introduce PEBR, which we believe is the first scheme that satisfies all the
             properties above.  PEBR is inspired by Snowflake's hybrid design of pointer- and
             epoch-based reclamation schemes (PBR and EBR, resp.) that is mostly robust, fast, and
             compact but neither self-contained nor widely applicable.  To achieve
             self-containedness, we design algorithms using only the standard C/C++ concurrency
             features and process-wide memory fence.  To achieve wide applicability, we characterize
             PEBR's requirement for safe reclamation that is satisfied by a variety of data
             structures, including Harris's and Harris-Herlihy-Shavit's lists that are not supported
             by PBR.  We experimentally evaluate whether PEBR is fast and robust using
             microbenchmarks, for which PEBR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art schemes."
