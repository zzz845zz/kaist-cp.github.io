In a close collaboration with [FuriosaAI](https://www.furiosa.ai/) and several companies and
research institutes, we are building AI accelerators and their compilers. We are planning to produce
a chip using **TSMC 7nm process**.

AI accelerators are specialized hardware purpose-built to achieve high performance by exploiting the
intrinsic parallelism of the workloads. AI accelerators are expected to revolutionize the IT
industry just as GPUs did a while ago.

To better serve the target workloads, accelerators break the common abstraction layers established
for general-purpose hardware like CPU. So it is difficult to design compilers for those accelerators
that achieve programmability and efficiency at the same time. We are focused on developing such a
compiler.
